                  coreutil-wrapper
  ================================================

  This is a wrapper for the rust coreutils command
  that allows you to run commands directly: `sort`
  instead of `coreutils sort`. Arguments and stdin
  are of course forwarded to the desired command!!

  You should usually not call me directly, instead
  run me with the --link flag to create a shim for
  each command in the current working directory :3
  Make sure the directory is in your PATH, or else
  you won't actually be able to call the commands!

  Usage:
     --help: Show this help message and exit (^_^)
     --link: Create a shim for each command in the
             current directory. This will override
             any existing files with the same name
     --drop: Delete shims in the current directory
     --pwsh: Help with removing powershell aliases
